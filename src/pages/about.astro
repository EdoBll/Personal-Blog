<p>Cybersecurity engineer with a background in System Administration and technical support, currently working in the Telco sector. I run penetration tests on both hardware—focusing on IoT devices and embedded systems—and software, focusing on vulnerabilities that affect real deployments. Driven by continuous learning, I publish in this Blog deep‑dive analyses, hands‑on walkthroughs and reproducible case studies that bridge theory and practice.
